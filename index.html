        <h2>Example: Froggy Loquito</h2>
        <p>Letâ€™s take an example to illustrate how this service works:</p>
        <p><strong>Froggy Loquito</strong> is a user who wants to link their identity to their Stacks wallet.</p>
        <p>Hereâ€™s what Froggy Loquito does:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Froggy meets with a human notary and certifies that their Stacks wallet, <code>SP3E8B51MF5E28BD82FM95VDSQ71VK4KFNZX7ZK2R</code>, belongs to them and that only they can access it.</li>
            <li>They then upload a digitized version of the notarized document to the on-chain-notary serviceâ€™s website.</li>
            <li>The on-chain-notary service verifies the document and links Froggyâ€™s identity to their Stacks wallet on the blockchain.</li>
            <li>If Froggy ever becomes aware that their wallet is compromised, they notify the service and provide a new notarized document to unlink the wallet from their identity.</li>
            <li>Froggy can now use their verified wallet to sign contracts and agreements securely on the blockchain, knowing that each signature is legally binding and protected.</li>
        </ol>
